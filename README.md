## 🧠 Notes
- All core algorithms in this repository are implemented **from scratch** (no training via high-level ML libraries).
- **Verification & Testing:** `pytest` is used for unit tests to validate correctness (edge cases, numerical stability).
- **Benchmarking:** `Scikit-learn` is used only as a **reference implementation** for comparison where applicable.
